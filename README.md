**The Thermostat Project - Final Project:**  
  The Thermostat project simulated a real-world thermostat by controlling the temperature states (OFF, HEAT, COOL) with LEDs, buttons, LCD display and a temperature sensor. I did particularly well in implementing the state machine locig and ensuring the system reflected real thermostat behavior. I could still improve on adding better error-handling logic to make the system more robust. I added adafruit library and statemachine framework which simplified GPIO control and LCD management. The use of temperature sensor and LCD displays will be definitely transferable to other projects in the future. I would like to test with other types of sensors as well. The project has modular classes and lots of inline comments which will make the project maintainable, readable and adaptable.  

**The Morse Code - Milestone 3:**       
  The Morse code project solved the problem of transmitting short messages using the LEDs and a 16x2 LCD display. It used a state machine to control timing for dots, dashes and pauses while a button allowed to toggle between the messages "SOS" and "OK". I think I did particularly well on breaking down the problem into distinct states and transitions. I could still improve on optimizing the code for better event and error handling. I added gpiozero to my support network. Some skills that are transferable to other projects and course work would be hardware-software interfacing, state machine design and LCD management. I made this project maintainable by using modular classes and using inline comments.
